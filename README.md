## Objective

This project aims to analyze employee attrition data to identify major trends impacting HR policies. The analysis includes designing a relational database model using MySQL to store data, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python, and building an attrition analysis dashboard with Power BI. This project aims to develop a Power BI Dashboard to comprehend employee attrition and explore the factors contributing to turnover, facilitating the development of effective retention strategies. The goal is to enhance retention and strengthen the workforce through actionable insights presented in the dashboard.

## Dataset

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance, includes details such as employee demographics, job attributes, performance ratings, and attrition status, facilitating analysis and understanding of turnover factors.


## Questions

1. What is the overall attrition rate, and how does it vary by gender?
2. Which age group experiences the highest attrition?
3. How does attrition vary across different departments?
4. Which job roles have the highest attrition rates?
5. What is the correlation between years of service at the company and attrition?
6. How does monthly salary affect attrition? Does a low salary lead to high attrition?
7. Is there a relationship between overtime work and attrition?
8. Is there a difference in attrition rates between high-performance and low-performance employees?
9. How does the work-life balance affect attrition? Do employees tend to quit when work-life balance is low?

## Conclusion

The analysis highlights areas where targeted interventions can enhance employee retention. By addressing factors like work-life balance and compensation, implementing strategies to support employees in high-turnover roles, and fostering a supportive work environment, the company can reduce attrition rates and improve organizational stability. Proactive measures aligned with these insights can lead to a more engaged and committed workforce, ultimately contributing to long-term success.
